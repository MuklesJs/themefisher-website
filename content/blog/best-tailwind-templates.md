<A href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind CSS</A> frameworks' popularity has grown significantly over the years. It's pretty simple and offers low-level utility classes for creating personalized designs. Unlike other CSS frameworks, it won't limit your originality with opinionated styles & pre-made components.

If you look at <A href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</A>, they have a vast library of themes built with their front-end development framework and submitted by numerous authors. All the themes in their theme section are organized, categorized, and kept in one place.

On the other hand, the Tailwind CSS framework offers a beautiful collection of <A href="https://tailwindui.com/components">UI components</A>, but they don't have any themes library on their official site.
