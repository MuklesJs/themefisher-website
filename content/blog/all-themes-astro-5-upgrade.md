**We're thrilled to announce that all 30+ of our Astro themes have been fully upgraded to Astro 5.0!**

On December 3, 2024, Astro released <A href="https://astro.build/blog/astro-5/">Astro 5.0</A>, bringing major improvements in performance, content management, and developer experience. As early adopters of Astro, we at Themefisher knew we had to bring these advancements to our customers as soon as possible.

We know many of you have been eager to see how our themes would leverage Astro 5.0. But since we have many products and projects built with Astro, upgrading wasn’t easy. We had to experiment, upgrade, test, and finally ship the updates to our existing customers to ensure a smooth transition.

After a meticulous upgrade process, we’re thrilled to announce that all of our Astro themes are now fully updated to Astro 5.0!


#### **Why Upgrade? What’s New in Astro 5?**

For those unfamiliar, Astro is a revolutionary framework for building fast, content-driven websites. Version 5 takes this to the next level with:

- **Content Layer:** A new, type-safe API that replaces content collections, offering seamless data integration.
- **Server Islands:** A smarter hybrid rendering approach that makes dynamic content even more efficient.
- **Simplified Prerendering:** Say goodbye to complex hybrid/static configurations—prerendering is now more intuitive.
- **Vite 6 Integration:** One of the first frameworks to adopt Vite 6, bringing a better development experience.
- **Faster Builds & Lower Memory Usage:** Up to **5x faster Markdown builds**, **2x faster MDX**, and **25-50% less memory consumption**.


#### **Themefisher's Journey to Astro 5**

Upgrading 30+ themes was no small feat. We faced several challenges, including adapting to breaking changes like the shift from `slug` to `id` in content collections and the new content rendering syntax. But we persevered—refactoring code, carefully managing dependencies with tools like `@astrojs/upgrade`, and ensuring every theme is optimized for Astro 5's powerful new features.


#### **What This Means for You**

- **Blazing Fast Websites:** Experience significantly faster page loads and improved SEO thanks to Astro 5's performance optimizations.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Dynamic content and personalized experiences will delight your visitors.
- **Future-Proof Themes:** Your Themefisher themes are now built on the latest and greatest version of Astro, ensuring compatibility and access to future updates.
