A Git-based headless CMS is a content management system that uses Git version control to manage content and provides seamless collaboration between content managers and web developers. Git typically uses files to store and manage content in its decentralized repository. This approach allows developers to use their preferred tools and workflows while providing a flexible and scalable solution for managing content.

Here are some popular Git-based headless CMSs options for you:
