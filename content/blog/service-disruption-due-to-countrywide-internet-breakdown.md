Dear Valued Customers and Clients,

We are writing to inform you of a significant disruption in our services due to an unprecedented situation in Bangladesh. As you may be aware, widespread student protests have led to a nationwide internet shutdown imposed by the government. This disruption commenced on July 18th, affecting our ability to provide uninterrupted customer support, respond to inquiries, and fulfill our commitments.

We understand the inconvenience this may cause, and we sincerely apologize for any disruption to your experience. Our team is committed to restoring normal operations as soon as possible.

While internet connectivity has been partially restored in certain areas, our office remains offline. To share this urgent announcement, we have temporarily accessed internet services from a co-working space.

We are closely monitoring the situation and hope to resume full operations within the next week.

Thank you for your understanding and patience during this challenging time. We appreciate your continued support.

Sincerely, <br />

Team Themefisher
