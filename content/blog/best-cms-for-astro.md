## What is a CMS, and why do you need for Astro?

Imagine building a website without the hassle of writing complex code. A Content Management System (CMS) makes this possible by providing a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and publishing content. Think of it as a simplified website editor where you can write content and upload media just like you would in a word processor.

**Other Structured Content:** CMSes are ideal for managing any type of content that follows a specific structure or format.

### Can you go without a CMS in Astro?

CMS providers offer a variety of features that can make it much easier to create a website from scratch. These features include templates, plugins, and content management tools. However, CMS providers can be expensive, and they may not be as flexible as custom-built websites. If you are considering using a CMS, it is important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks carefully.
